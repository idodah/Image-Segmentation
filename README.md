# Image-Segmentation

In this assignment i used detectron2 in order to remove sky from a coco dataset images. To do that I cropped the image
from the lowest pixel that has sky to the highest. 

## The dataset- Quickstart Geo
A small dataset with geolocation data.
The dataset consists of 500 images from the validation split of the BDD100K dataset in the New York City area with object detections and GPS timestamps.
Dataset size: 33.50 MB
